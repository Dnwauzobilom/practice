        <h1><strong>Introduction to html</strong></h1>
        <h2>Talking about all that I've learnt in HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> which uses elements to tell the browser how to display its content.</p>
        <h2><b>Html Building Blocks</b></h2>
        According to the tutor, there are 3 major basic building blocks which include the <i>following:</i>
        *<mark>Tags</mark>
        *<mark>Attributes</mark>
        *<mark>Elements</mark>
        <h2><b>HTML FORMATTING</b></h2>
        <p>There are so many html formatting elements which are designed to specially identify some texts which the designer wants to point out specially.</p> To mention few of these formatting elements, I'll also attach the function of those elements mentioned.
        <i>These elements include the following:</i>
        <b>Bold text</b>, <strong>Important text</strong>, <i>Italic text</i>, <em>Emphasized text</em>, <mark>Marked text</mark>, <small>Smaller text</small>, <del>Deleted text</del>, <ins>Inserted text</ins>, <sub>Subscript Text</sub>, <sup>Superscript Text</sup>.
        <p>It is worthy of note that for every opening tag, there must be a corresponding closing tag and a closing tag is identified by a <mark>forward-slash (/) in front of the opening tag which converts the opening tag into a closing tag</mark>.</p>
        <h2><b>HTML HEADINGS</b></h2>
        <p>In HTML, there are six(6) different heading tags ranging from h1 to h6</p>. h1 is the largest heading tag, and h6 is the smallest heading tag.
        h1 being the largest heading tag implies that h1 is used for the most important heading while h6 is used for the least important heading.
